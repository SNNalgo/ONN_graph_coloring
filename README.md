This is an implementation of graph-coloring solution using the oscillatory neural networks framework

This solution is implemented with Intel-LAVA Processes to define neurons and inter-neuron connections

Dependencies - lava-optimization

Description:
* graph_col_dimacs_reader.py - reads DIMACS format graphs
* cordic_fxp.py - Fixed Point implementation of the CORDIC algorithm to compute sines and cosines
* GraphColoringSoln.py and GraphColoringSolnFixedPt.py - Solution files containing relevant Process definitions
* GraphColoringTest.py, GraphColoringTestCordic.py, GraphColoringTestCordic_col.py - test scripts for graph coloring
